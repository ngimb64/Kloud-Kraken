How the client goroutines interact with the brain server
---

- Client connects back to server

loop:
    - Client checks disk space to ensure there is room for transfer
        - If there is not, wait until there is available room

    - Client sends message to server to initiate transfer

    - Server responds to the client:
        - With the start transfer message
        OR
        - With the end transfer message because all available data has been sent
        - The client will also send the end transfer message through the channel
        - exit loop

    loop:
        - A file is transferred from the Server to the client in chunks

    - When complete the client sends the filename through a channel to another goroutine for processing

loop:
    - The channel receives
        - The filename
        OR
        - The end transfer message
        - exit loop

    - The filename is passed into command execution as argument

    - The execution results are formatted and returned from the client to the server

    - The processing goroutine goes back to waiting for data input from the channel
