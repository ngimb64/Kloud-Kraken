- Implement mutual TLS over TCP for connections (Network Programming With Go book is great reference)

- Implement tests for above TLS code

- Add docstrings to added TLS code and ensure code is documented

- Rerun testing locally

- Test and modify Makefile

- Add AWS code, CloudWatch code to Kloudlogs, double check unit test, and test with AWS
    - Ensure user data include bash script which updates and installs hashcat, then transfers compiled client service binary from server

- Do remaining unit tests for Kloudlogs after AWS code is added

- Add needed docstrings in kloudlogs if needed

- Rerun integration tests in AWS environment

- Try improving tests related to file io with potential memory-based io providers (read blog)
    - Also look into using testing lib for file related operations instead of os

- Try to fix rustmerger and replace original wordlist merging logic with it
