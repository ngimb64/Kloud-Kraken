- Rerun testing locally

- Add AWS code, CloudWatch code to Kloudlogs, double check unit test, and test with AWS
    - Ensure user data include bash script which updates and installs hashcat, then transfers compiled client service binary from server

- Add needed docstrings in kloudlogs if needed

- Test and modify Makefile to ensure binaries are transfered to EC2 instance

- Rerun system testing in AWS environment

- Implement unit tests for tlsutils, awsutils, & kloudlogs

- Try improving tests related to file io with potential memory-based io providers (read blog)
    - Also look into using testing lib for file related operations instead of os
