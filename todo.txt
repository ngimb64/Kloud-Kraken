- Write and run unit tests
    - Write most tests for kloudlogs
    - Write tests for netio
    - Write tests for wordlist

- Might (but probably not) have to add more messaging logic if client is unable to proceed with file transfer due to disk space
    - The server uses a sync map to ensure unique files are selected so the file path should be removed

- Run integration tests locally to get baseline working

- Implement mutual TLS over TCP for connections (Network Programming With Go book is great reference)

- Implement tests for above TLS code

- Add docstrings to added TLS code and wherever needed

- Rerun integration tests locally

- Test and modify Makefile

- Build provisioner script for AMI to upload compiled client code and setup clients

- Add AWS code, CloudWatch code to Kloudlogs, double check unit test, and test with AWS

- Do unit remaining tests for Kloudlogs now that AWS code is added

- Add needed docstrings in kloudlogs

- Rerun integration tests in AWS environment

- Try improving tests related to file io with potential memory-based io providers (read blog)
    - Also look into using testing lib for file related operations instead of os

- Try to fix rustmerger and replace original wordlist merging logic with it
